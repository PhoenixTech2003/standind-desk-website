                <p>This minimalist desk with clean lines and plenty of desktop space is clearly made with work-from-homers in mind, as it combines one of the most efficient motorised mechanisms we tested, with straightforward assembly, which won’t take more than an hour.

                    The lowest this desk will go is 62.5cm, which is great if you’re not super tall, and it raises to 128cm, so you’ll still be able to work ergonomically, even if you’re 6ft plus. It’s capable of supporting 125kg, so you won’t have to worry about overloading it, even if you’ve got a multiple monitor setup, and the table was still rock solid when raised to its highest limit. Dimensions wise, it’s 120-200cm in width x 60-80cm in depth.

                    This table from the Swedish flat-pack specialist was suitably straightforward to assemble and raises via a handle and crank from 70cm to 120cm. Unlike some other cranked tables we’ve seen, the Ikea desk’s crank slides back under the table once you’ve set the height, to stop you impaling yourself on it when you get up to make a cup of tea.

                    With 50kg of load and a 120cm x 70cm working area, the table is functional for all kinds of working practices, whether you’re sitting at a keyboard and screen or actually making something.

                    If you’re happy with the desk you have but would like the option to sit-stand, this riser will sit on top and give you that freedom of movement, raising your keyboard up to 35cm from the base while the desktop itself goes up to 50cm, so you should easily be able to find an optimum working height.

                    The gas-assisted lifting mechanism is very easy to operate. When you want to sit down, the whole unit lowers, so your keyboard sits flush to your existing desk, with the monitor sitting at 15cm.

                    This desk offers four different sizes of top plate, so, if you work pretty minimally, you can opt for the 120cm x 80cm desk. However, there is also a 180cm x 80cm top that will ensure you can really spread out, without feeling cramped while you work.

                    The dual motors were very smooth, raising the table (via a responsive keypad) between 64cm and 130cm, and we had no worrying wobbles when working at the upper reaches of the table’s standing mode.
                    
                    The table has a 100kg weight capacity, which means you can work with confidence, even if it has to accommodate a sizeable digital setup.

                    Right, we’re pretty good at DIY, but it was a bit of a struggle putting the Jarvis together. However, we can say you won’t be disappointed with the end result, because the table supports an astonishing 158kg and is made from premium materials that are built to last – particularly the sustainably grown and harvested bamboo, which looks fantastic and is very workable. There’s plenty of space for your setup, too, with worktop dimensions measuring 120cm x 80cm.

                    The motorised lifting mechanism is impressively fluid (using up and down arrows on the keypad), and the table is one of the most customisable on the market, with two shapes and seven sizes, so you should easily be able to find a configuration that is tailored to your office space.

                    The minimal aesthetic of this desk would make it a very welcome addition to a modern work space, and the fact there are a mind-boggling number of combinations to choose from in terms of the frame colour and finish of the hard-wearing melamine top means you should have no trouble blending the desk into your space.

                    Putting the desk together was straightforward, and the lightweight components meant we didn’t need another pair of hands to help. Once assembled, the desk felt strong and stable, even when raised to the maximum height of 125cm.

                    The electric height adjustment mechanism was smooth without any judder, and the desk itself will take 75kg of weight, so will easily be able to accommodate most office setups.

                    If you are one of those workers who’s constantly up and down throughout the working day, this table (made from recyclable steel and aluminium) has one of the fastest mechanisms on test. Rather than motors, the float relies on a constant force spring and counterbalance mechanism to raise and lower the top plate over 50cm of height, via a paddle placed just underneath the table. The transition is smooth, strangely satisfying to operate and, most importantly, quick.

                    The range offered tops out at 120cm and the desk can support 58kg, but the float was absolutely solid at the top level and never moved, even when we were leaning on it. This is an expensive desk but it’s also supremely functional and impressively engineered and, again, it’s highly customisable – we specifically liked the under-table keyboard system, where the keyboard can be hidden away in a pull-out drawer to give you even more room on the desktop and reduce clutter when the desk isn’t in use.

                    Children’s posture is rarely a problem, but kids’ sit-stand desks can still be really useful, as they stop those bad postural habits slowly creeping in.

                    This Flexispot table features a similar mechanism to the company’s adult desks, so your child can switch from sitting down in front of their homework to standing up for a spot of crafting, without any hassle. This is thanks to a one-touch button that easily raises the table between heights (ranging from 77.5cm to 87.5cm).

                    There’s plenty of room on the waterproof top plate for exercise books and organisers, thanks to the desk’s 100cm x 60cm dimensions, plus there are some kid-friendly features – such as a hook from which they can hang their schoolbag, so it’s easily accessible.

                    If you have a larger working area, particularly one that’s suitable for a corner desk, this UK manufacturer has come up with a desk with three efficient motors that will raise the right-angled desktop at the touch of a button. The desk ranges in height from 70cm to 123cm, allowing taller individuals to still work ergonomically, although, there is also a pro 3+ version (£899.95, Yo-yodesk.co.uk) with a height range of up to 127cm – making it suitable for users up to 6ft 8in.

                    The spacious table didn’t suffer from any wobble at the higher ranges of height, and the powder-coated top plate comes in 10 colours.

                    Not all sit-stand desks rely on motors and fancy mechanisms. If you don’t want a permanent sit-stand option, this birch plywood desk offers both laptop and desktop users the opportunity to feel the benefits of standing. It sets up on an existing desk within minutes, offering a simple system of seven slots into which you can fit two shelves, according to how you want your laptop and screens to be set up.

                    At the highest level, the stan 2 will raise a monitor 32cm above the height of your original desk, and the whole thing is very easy to pack away again at the end of the working day.
